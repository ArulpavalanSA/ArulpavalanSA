## 👋 Hello! I'm Arul

I'm a first-year Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) student at NIT Trichy, passionate about embedded systems, electronics design, and applied engineering.

I enjoy building systems that blend hardware and software — from microcontrollers to sensors, PCBs to signal processing. I strongly believe in learning by doing and documenting every step of the journey.

### 🔧 Current Focus Areas
- Embedded development using **STM32 (STM32F4 & Blue Pill boards)**  
- Sensor fusion, state estimation, and Kalman filtering for real-time applications  
- PCB design using **KiCad** for custom electronics  
- Strengthening my core in circuits, control systems, and signal processing

---

### 🚀 Projects & Learning
- Developing apogee detection and recovery systems for high-altitude model rockets  
- Interfacing modules like **ADXL345**, **Neo-6M GPS**, **DSP310 barometer**  
- Designing a **buck converter** using **TLV62569ADRL** and simulating it for real-world loads

---

### 🎯 Goals
- Build a strong foundation in electronics and embedded design  
- Contribute to open-source hardware/software projects  
- Maintain a balance between academics and hands-on exploration
